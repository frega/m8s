**Maintainer**: Nick Schuch

## Overview

M8s is a CLI and API for building temporary environments in Kubernetes.

Often in your CI/CD workflows, you want a real environment to run automated or manual tests. For example, you might want to preview changes you are making in a branch or Pull Request. m8s provides a simple tool for acheiving this. It takes a docker compose file, and translates that into a pod definition Kubernetes understands, and deploys it on Kubernetes. The pod is _ephemeral_, meaning it's not meant to stick around for long, and any data will be deleted once the pod is removed.

## Getting Started

To get started you will need 1 of each of the following:

**Cluster**

Kubernetes and the M8s API server running.

* GKE ([Easy](/docs/cluster/gcp/easy.md)|[Comprehensive](/docs/cluster/gcp/comprehensive.md))
* Openshift - Coming soon...
* Kops - Coming soon...

**Pipelines**

A continuous integration service / setup which will send information to the M8s API.

* [CircleCI](/docs/pipeline/circleci/circleci.md)
* Bitbucket Pipelines - Coming soon...
* Jenkins - Coming soon...
* TravisCI - Coming soon...

**Projects**

Example implementations for applications.

* [Drupal](/docs/project/drupal/drupal.md)

## Documentation

* [Cache](/docs/cache.md)

git clone git@github.com:<your github>/m8s $GOPATH/src/github.com/<your github>/m8s

# Change into the project to run workflow commands.
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/<your github>/m8s
```

**Installing a new dependency**

```bash
dep ensure -add github.com/foo/bar
```
